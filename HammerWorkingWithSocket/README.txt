hammerModified.js is just the hammer library with altered times for the 
 press event minimum time(now 51 ms) and the tap maximum time (now 50 ms).

BasicHammer.html is just there to prove that the hammerModified.js file
 does in fact work and can be connected to.

You'll have to also download the node_modules folder from the 
 Socket_io_example because I cant figure out how to upload the folder myself
 because it is too large to drag and drop into GitHub
